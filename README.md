## Introduction

This repo holds Speckle's Excel Connector, it's currently released as early alpha.

## Documentation

Comprehensive developer and user documentation can be found in our:

## Developing & Debugging

### App Set up

For developing and debugging this connector you'll need to set up a Speckle App.
The server on which the app runs must be on `https`, so **do not use a local Speckle server** on `http://localhost:3000/` as it will not work.

You can use `https://latest.speckle.systems/` or `https://app.speckle.systems/`.

Now open up its frontend, and under your profile register a new app.

I've used the following values since my excel-connector app is running at `https://localhost:3000`:

- name: ExcelConnector
- redirect url: `https://localhost:3000`
- permissions: `streams:read, streams:write, profile:read, profile:email, users:read`

Take note of the `app id` and `secret`, then in your speckle-excel repo:

- duplicate `.env sample` to `.env.local`
- then fill it in with your new `app id` and `secret`
- note that the `BASE_URL=https://localhost:3000`

### Running the connector locally

Run it locally:

- `npm install` (first time only)
- `npm run serve`
- _You might be prompted to install some certificates, go ahead and accept_
- _Wait for the the process to start the Vue app, then in a separate terminal either_
  - `npm run excel` will run excel desktop and sideload the plugin
  - `npm run excel:web` will run excel web, open the document defined in `packages.json` and sideload the plugin

If this worked out well, you should see the connector sideloaded correctly:
